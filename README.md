# Should Cost Model Builder

This tool can be used to create "should cost" models. That is, given known direct costs of a product or service, indirect percentages (i.e. SG&A, R%D, and EBIT margins), and actual/current/quoted pricing, this tool can estimate the gap between the actual cost and the should cost.
